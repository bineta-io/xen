## What is Xen?

Xen is a browser extension that helps you write smart, witty, and insightful replies on X/Twitter using Artificial Intelligence. It adds a special "Xen" button right next to the standard reply button on tweets.

## üöÄ Get Started

Xen is a Plasmo extension. Here's how to install it in your browser:

1.  **Clone the project:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bineta-io/xen.git
    cd xen
    ```
2.  **Install necessary files:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Build the extension:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This creates a `build/chrome-mv3-prod` folder.
4.  **Load in your browser (Chrome/Brave/Edge):**
    1.  Go to `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions`, `edge://extensions`).
    2.  Turn on "Developer mode" (usually in the top right).
    3.  Click "Load unpacked" and choose the `build/chrome-mv3-prod` folder.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Enter your OpenRouter API Key:** Click the Xen extension icon in your browser toolbar. A small window will pop up where you can enter your OpenRouter API key. This key is saved only on your computer.
2.  **Generate Replies:** Go to X/Twitter. You'll see a new "Xen" button next to the reply button on tweets. Click it, and Xen will generate a witty reply based on the tweet and automatically put it in the reply box for you.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

To work on Xen:

1.  **Clone the project:**

2.  **Install necessary files:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start development server:**
